*	__Some Gestalt principles of perception__
	*	__Proximity__
		*	Objects appearing close to each other are perceived as a group or unit.
	*	__Similarity__
		*	Objects that share similar characteristics are perceived as belonging to the same group or unit.
	*	__Closure__

		*	How the position of elements affects our perception (information grouping and flow).
